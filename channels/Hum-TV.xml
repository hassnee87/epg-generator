<desc lang="en">Meesni is the story of Sahira, a girl who wants it all and doesn’t care about who gets hurt in the way. A girl who has never been a good daughter, sister or a good wife. But will Sahira be the same once she becomes a mother? Will she be able to change her ways or will her daughters have to bear the burdens of her past?Meesni drama encompasses the actions and tale of Sahira, a girl who wants it all and doesn’t care about who gets hurt in the way. A girl who has never been a good daughter, sister or a good wife. She was born in a poor family and has improbable dreams of getting rich by means of deception and ploys. She uses her beauty as a weapon to pierce through people’s hearts and lives. Preying on two brothers one after the other, Sahira destroys the familial bond for her treacherous reasons and tears the family apart.Zaid, younger brother of Waleed falls prey to Sahira’s gambits first, and is heartbroken after her deception. The same fate follows Waleed, when Sahira deliberately enters his life and persuade him into her charms. The story continues to reveal the tragic destruction of the families on account of Sahira’s actions. The anticipation that Sahira might change her ways when she becomes a mother also crushes when she abandons her daughter heartlessly to carry on with her selfish endeavors. People continue to perish around her but nothing seems to break her conducts on being callous and putting herself above everything, even above morality.

The story continues to reveal the tragic destruction of the families on account of Sahira’s actions. The anticipation that Sahira might change her ways when she becomes a mother also crushes when she abandons her daughter heartlessly to carry on with her selfish endeavors. People continue to perish around her but nothing seems to break her conducts on being callous and putting herself above everything, even above morality.

<desc lang="en">Meesni is the story of Sahira, a girl who wants it all and doesn’t care about who gets hurt in the way. A girl who has never been a good daughter, sister or a good wife. But will Sahira be the same once she becomes a mother? Will she be able to change her ways or will her daughters have to bear the burdens of her past?Meesni drama encompasses the actions and tale of Sahira, a girl who wants it all and doesn’t care about who gets hurt in the way. A girl who has never been a good daughter, sister or a good wife. She was born in a poor family and has improbable dreams of getting rich by means of deception and ploys. She uses her beauty as a weapon to pierce through people’s hearts and lives. Preying on two brothers one after the other, Sahira destroys the familial bond for her treacherous reasons and tears the family apart.Zaid, younger brother of Waleed falls prey to Sahira’s gambits first, and is heartbroken after her deception. The same fate follows Waleed, when Sahira deliberately enters his life and persuade him into her charms. The story continues to reveal the tragic destruction of the families on account of Sahira’s actions. The anticipation that Sahira might change her ways when she becomes a mother also crushes when she abandons her daughter heartlessly to carry on with her selfish endeavors. People continue to perish around her but nothing seems to break her conducts on being callous and putting herself above everything, even above morality.
