<desc lang="en">Shikanja is a gripping tale of deceit, deception, and the price of unchecked ambition.
Rani, a beautiful yet manipulative woman, loves Saqib and cunningly marries him.
However, her obsession with control soon begins to destroy everything Saqib holds dear. Saqib’s sisters, Fizza and Rida, become the primary victims of Rani’s cruelty.
Zaroon, Rani’s brother, deeply loves Fizza, but Rani’s envy and desire for power stand in their way. Her schemes unleash chaos that shatters relationships and tears the family apart. As she tightens her grip on the household, Rani manipulates everyone, reducing Fizza and Rida to mere servants of her will. Amidst the turmoil, Zaroon remains the only beacon of hope – determined to protect Fizza from Rani’s deceit.
Will Zaroon save Fizza from Rani’s manipulation? Will Saqib uncover the truth about his wife? And will love, truth, and justice triumph over Rani’s unrelenting hunger for control?
