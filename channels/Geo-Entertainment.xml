<desc lang="en">Mannat is a beautiful young girl who hails from a progressive family that values love, care, and mutual respect. Raised in an environment where everyone's choices are respected, Mannat enjoys the freedom to make her own decisions. Following the untimely demise of her parents, she finds support from her elder brother, Nafees, who showers her with affection.
On the other hand, Murad belongs to a conservative family where his mother, the matriarch, wields significant influence over his life choices. As the only son, Murad is burdened with the responsibility of fulfilling his family's expectations. Soft-spoken and romantic by nature, Murad finds himself unable to defy his mother's authority, especially after the passing of his father.
Despite their starkly contrasting backgrounds, Mannat and Murad's hearts find solace in each other's presence, and they fall deeply in love. However, their families' interference creates misunderstandings between Mannat and Murad, testing the strength of their bond.
Will their families agree to their union? Will Mannat's family, with their open-mindedness, find common ground with Murad's conservative household? Can Mannat and Murad's love for each other withstand the motives of their families, who seek to create further misunderstandings between them?
